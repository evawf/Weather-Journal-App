#Weather Journal App

This is my third project from Udacity - Front End Web Developer Course. The purpose of this project is to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.

##Coding Steps
- Setup Node environment with Express
- Add required dependencies
- Setup server with GET and POST routes
- Create developer credentials for Web API
- Use the Fetch API with my credentials and user input to get dynamic data into my app routes
- Access a GET route on the server side, from a function called on the client side
- Chain Promises together
- Access HTML elements with JavaScript and set their properties dynamically
- Fix errors
- Clean up code

##Libraries 
I used below two libraries:
- OpenWeather API, click [here](https://openweathermap.org/) for more details
- Mapbox GL JS, click [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/) for more info.

##Usage
- Clone or download this repo 
- Input your API keys in .env file, then you can try this app
